# Future IT College — MERN Stack Application

Full-stack website + Student Portal + Online Examination System + Admin
Panel with Question Bank Management. Same original UI/UX, colors,
typography and animations throughout.

## Structure

```
future-it-college/
  client/   React 19 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
  server/   Node.js + Express + MongoDB + JWT
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd server
npm install
cp .env.example .env          # edit MONGODB_URI etc. if needed
npm run seed                   # website content: Courses, Faculty, Gallery
npm run seed:exam               # exam module: Categories, Admin, Questions, Test
npm run dev                     # http://localhost:5000
```

`npm run seed:exam` prints the default admin login:
`admin@futureitcollege.com` / `Admin@123` (change via `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` /
`SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` before seeding).

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd client
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev                     # http://localhost:5173
```

## Exam Engine Notes

- Every student gets a **random 50-question paper** with **randomized
  option order**, generated server-side and stored per-attempt in MongoDB.
- The **15-minute timer** is driven by a server-issued `expiresAt`
  timestamp — refreshing or closing the browser and returning restores
  the exact remaining time; the server also auto-submits if the timer
  has expired whenever the attempt is fetched or an answer is saved.
- **Auto-save** persists every selected answer immediately.
- **One attempt only** is enforced per student per test unless the
  admin enables `allowRetest` on that test.

## Future-Ready Architecture (present, not yet wired to UI)

Negative marking, multiple-correct-answer questions, image/code-snippet
questions, certificate download, notes/assignments/attendance/video
lectures/fees/notifications — relevant model fields and folders are
already in place per the original spec.

## Security

- Passwords hashed with bcrypt.
- JWT-based auth with separate student/admin roles enforced server-side.
- All admin mutation routes require a valid admin JWT.
- express-validator on every write endpoint.
